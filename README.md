## UFC Event Geospatial Analysis
By webscraping UFC event data from the UFC stats website (title, location, date) using BeautifulSoup, I built choropleth maps using folium to analyze the distribution of events across location and time, both in the United States and Worldwide. These visualizations could be used to analyze potential points of interest for UFC event expansion.
